To use this repository you only need to run the code using Python 3 versions and the necessary libraries are all in Anaconda.

### Project Motivation
The motivation for this project is to make an analysis on a Seattle Airbnb dataset with data from the activity in the plataform. The analysis aims to answer the questions:

- What months of the year register more activities in Seattle Airbnb?
- Which Seattle regions have the accomodations with the biggest mean prices?
- Is it possible to predict the accomodation price by using attributes such as neiborhood, number of roons, etc?

### File Descriptions 
The dataset was download from the kaggle page : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 and it is available in this repository in the 'dataset/' folder.
